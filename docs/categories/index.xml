      <description>Digital History - Week 2 Here are a few thoughts about our readings. First, I find it strange that “Time on the Cross” would use data from one plantation as the norm for all plantations. Maybe I read something wrong, but those authors are a prime example of misuse and misapplication of data that is subjective to multiple interpretations. There are common problems in statistics with taking biased human opinions and trying to make statistical data out of it.</description>
