          Digital History for April 25, 2018 &ldquo;What is Code&rdquo; by Paul Ford I discovered right away that this author has some strong opinions and I chuckled at a few key phrases and then I thought he was a little too disparaging. And then I read his opinion that programming does not require intelligence. Whoa! What?! There is one other person that I know that is a programmer and says “it’s easy.

          Digital History for April 11, 2018 &ldquo;Seven Ways Humanists are Using Computers to Understand Text&rdquo; by Ted Underwood Hearing about the projects others have made to look up words that were used during a certain time frame have left me wondering about usefulness. I don’t need a computer computation to know that people used to say “groovy” a lot and now it’s barely used at all. How far did the use of “groovy” go around the world, I don’t know and that bit of information seems to be as useful as knowing how many shingles are on the roof of my house.

          Voyant I was eager to get back to this tool after class. Even now after messing with another tool, I am liking Voyant. For the first time I have learned the point to a Cirrus visual. I just thought it was some trendy thing but it has a point. I am still working with the Shakespeare data that Voyant offers. I think Voyant presents information in a way that makes a data set intriguing.

I did like the different graphs and I think I learned more about graphs here than I ever did in any school. It probably helps that computers are used much more than the rocks we were given to use for all of our subjects. I don&rsquo;t think all graphs can be used so well for certain information and I did come across one which made me wonder that it wouldn&rsquo;t be useful for any kind of information.

          Digital History for April 4, 2018 “Visualization and Historical Arguments” by John Theibault I couldn’t help but think back to some of the awesome visualizations we have already been through in class. The Napoleon advance into Russia was a happy memory. Then my smile was quickly wiped off my face as he brought up the accuracy of graphs and if they are valid to the information around it. I can’t say I have read anything that didn’t match with the visual.

          Carto I found Carto extremely frustrating but I have noticed this happen on any webpage with a map. A person tries to scroll in or out of the map and the zoom goes to the extreme. Okay, that can be handled carefully. The real annoyance is when, less carefully, we go to scroll down the page. The webpage does not move but our carefully centered map has done bonkers and will require everything that we just did to it.

          Digital History for March 28, 2018 Stephen Robertson, “Putting Harlem on the Map” I was a little surprised that there was no mention of income level or the variances thereof. Robertson did mention crime, which goes hand in hand with crime. He did mention a man stealing to pay for his wife’s medical needs but that means that there is a poverty issue. The last two weeks have had me deep in Omaha neighborhoods.

          Digital History – March 7 I am liking Richard White a lot. I like the guy right away. His first map is even interesting. I still found something to be contrary about – “what is often clear enough in French becomes fashionably murky in English.” I do like that line but I’m gonna say it’s not fashionable; it’s just murky. Like when you try to watch a French movie and you get to the end and your just mad – murky with loose ends whipping around in the wind.

          MapWarper The ability to overlay an old map on top of a new one is genius. For me, I can see where the best chance to see historical buildings in a city by taking an old map and warping it to fit on a current map. The most notable change to the Omaha map that I used, was the change in the river. Not only was the river in a different position but some parts of the city, on the old map, were not even there anymore due to what seems reasonable to assume, that the river had flooded out the buildings.

          Airtable My database ended up a bit smaller than what we started with. I could not find a good way to insert the transcript of the letters. Any copy ended up giving me 18 more records with the transcript spread over all of them. Not only that, but they were also un-readable so it was not useful that way. I did discover that if I add to the transcript field itself, “long text,” it did not make multiple records but I still had to type in transcripts by hand.

          Digital History for Feb 28 Right off the bat I would say that the Spreadsheet Thinking vs Database Thinking would be great to have side by side with the OpenRefine class. I can’t help but think back to my skepticism of OpenRefine. I think I said something along the lines of it’s being just a spreadsheet, but reading this article makes things click into place. I was feeling better about things in general, until I read the comments, and now I’m appropriately back in my confidence-shaken place.

Good luck taking anyone to court for a picture they got off of the government website. Putting that watermark over the picture must mean absolutely nothing.

          OpenRefine What is challenging about the software? The software needs some UI work but other than that I think I may have had the wrong file of data or messed up with something early on. Hard to say since both files I entered as a new project did not match up with what the tutorial was talking about. I am skeptical of this tutorial. My UX on that tutorial is very low and I computer all day, so I’m not a complete idiot.

          The Lost Museum When I first found myself on their home page a video immediately started up explaining the Lost Museum as Barnum’s American Museum. The music in the background was so pronounced, and markedly bad, that I wondered if it was being used because it was an authentic recording. I did not find any such thing but did find a couple people credited for music in the About Us section, which did seem to give a wide berth of recognition to anyone involved in the website.

          Digital History Reflection Week 3 I don’t like the victim-like tone of the first article. “Many many fields” ug, please. Don’t use the same word twice when trying to make your point. “We need a more broad definition of digital history work to surface the involvement of women employed at non-academic organizations.” There would be so many more men that would also emerge here but that wouldn’t be fair would it.

          Digital History - Week 2 Here are a few thoughts about our readings. First, I find it strange that “Time on the Cross” would use data from one plantation as the norm for all plantations. Maybe I read something wrong, but those authors are a prime example of misuse and misapplication of data that is subjective to multiple interpretations. There are common problems in statistics with taking biased human opinions and trying to make statistical data out of it.

          Digital History - Week 1 The first thing I had to note the second I read it was in Friedman’s “Electric Dreams” on page 27. Friedman mentions John Perry Barlow’s writing of “Declaration of Independence for Cyberspace.” The second I read that title I had an immediate feeling of angry bitterness. That very phrase is null and void right now. Then Barlow says “the digital age cannot be denied or stopped.

          Using Hugo with Github Hugo is the program that compiles your web content (aka posts) into a website.
Hugo is completely separate from Github. Not related in any way.
All Hugo does is help you make a pretty website.
So, we can go to our terminal and enter the site directory by issuing the command
cd ~/Documents/digitalhistory.orphicoasis8.com  Now we can use any text editor or VS code to edit our posts
