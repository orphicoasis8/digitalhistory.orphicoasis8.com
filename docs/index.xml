      <description>&lt;p&gt;Far far away, behind the word mountains, far from the countries Vokalia and Consonantia, there live the blind texts. A small river named Duden flows by their place and supplies it with the necessary regelialia. It is a paradisematic country, in which roasted parts of sentences fly into your mouth.

      <title>Using Hugo and Github Like Good Friends</title>

      <description>Using Hugo with Github Hugo is the program that compiles your web content (aka posts) into a website.
Hugo is completely separate from Github. Not related in any way.
All Hugo does is help you make a pretty website.
So, we can go to our terminal and enter the site directory by issuing the command
cd ~/Documents/digitalhistory.orphicoasis8.com  Now we can use any text editor or VS code to edit our posts</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Even the all-powerful Pointing has no control about the blind texts it is an almost unorthographic life. One day however a small line of blind text by the name of Lorem Ipsum decided to leave for the far World of Grammar.
