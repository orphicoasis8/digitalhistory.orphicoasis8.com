## The Lost Museum

![](/img/week3-2 image1.png)
When I first found myself on their home page a video immediately started up explaining the Lost Museum as Barnum’s American Museum. The music in the background was so pronounced, and markedly bad, that I wondered if it was being used because it was an authentic recording. I did not find any such thing but did find a couple people credited for music in the About Us section, which did seem to give a wide berth of recognition to anyone involved in the website.
The Website is based on the happenings of this New York City museum from 1841 to 1865. Although the museum caught fire in 1865, Barnum opened another museum and there are a few documents from that museum as well. The museum covers the time periods of abolition and civil war and moves on to topics such as gender roles, race, and temperance. The website does its best to explain all the exhibitions they try to portray the museum for what we may see it today stating their information and entertainment exhibitions and then noting the “trumped-up fantasy and cruel voyeurism.” From what I could see they made an effort to present this piece of history with as many primary sources as they could get. The museum was a public place that made efforts to attract crowds and advertise so there are plenty of newspaper articles.These newspaper articles sometimes consist of letters back and forth with Barnum and whoever is attempting to molest him or who is at, or inevitably seems to end up at the other end. The website was made for U.S. History Courses, teachers and students, and for the average curious browser as well. There are almost a dozen activities the website has set up for classroom I was not so surprised to see Roy Rosenzweig credited in a couple different places for his collaboration in the website. It would seem he has his own center for history and new media. Aside from collaborators, I see most of the credit goes to programmers and advisors. There is also the mention of a major grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities. Humanities, histories, same difference. It would seem that the mother of this brain child would be Andrea Ades Vasquez.![](/img/week3-2 image2.png)There were a couple issues I had with the website from a user friendly perspective. Who is P.T. Barnum? I searched around and was unable to find a picture of this man. This is one of the first things I would want to see. It certainly helps to see the giant five story building so why not a picture of the man. I consider those to be one question or one nagging annoyance. My second wish is to see what all this mention of waxworks is all about. I thought I was clicking on links to see these curiosities but no. None of my clicking led me there. You also have to scroll down to the bottom of the page to get off of your current page and that leads to closing out of the tap just to get away from the one page.The Lost Museum is a great way to show that history is not boring. Unfortunately, I get the feeling that this website is entertaining in the same way that Barnum’s Museum was entertaining. We may not be paying the handicap person to sing and dance for us but it is that very thing that is making the next person click.
