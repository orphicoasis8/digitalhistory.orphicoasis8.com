## Carto

I found Carto extremely frustrating but I have noticed this happen on any webpage with a map. A person tries to scroll in or out of the map and the zoom goes to the extreme. Okay, that can be handled carefully. The real annoyance is when, less carefully, we go to scroll down the page. The webpage does not move but our carefully centered map has done bonkers and will require everything that we just did to it. Carto is frustrating for more than just that reason. There are options to make great maps but they are hard to find. I played with this map for more than a week and every time I came back to my computer I had forgotten how to work it. I could not find my cool animation again and gave up. I settled with changing the fields for each dot and grumbled at how that map would just have to do.

I see now that Carto will not show up on this webpage. The Carto page is urging me to look at their payment plans. ...uh, No ...  I will never use Carto. This exercise was in futility. I really, just wanted to say something dramatic. I will forget Carto and if they don't disappear in the next two years someone might ask me if I have ever used Carto and I will think about it and say "Ya know it sounds familiar," then when I actually have to sit down with it I will bellow a "NOOO." I know I'm being really subtle here but I'm trying to say that I very much dislike Carto. Maybe I should be thanking them for saving me the embarrassment of having to show the crappy map I made on their site.
