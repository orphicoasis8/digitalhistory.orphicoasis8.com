## Voyant
I was eager to get back to this tool after class. Even now after messing with another tool, I am liking Voyant. For the first time I have learned the point to a Cirrus visual. I just thought it was some trendy thing but it has a point. I am still working with the Shakespeare data that Voyant offers. I think Voyant presents information in a way that makes a data set intriguing. I have been enjoying myself with this tool. 

I found myself lining up my preferences for data visualizations. I realized I was sticking with a bunch of bar graphs. For some reason I felt a little embarrassed about this form of consistency. This also forced me to step outside of the box a bit so I could see something new.
