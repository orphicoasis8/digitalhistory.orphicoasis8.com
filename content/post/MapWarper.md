## MapWarperThe ability to overlay an old map on top of a new one is genius. For me, I can see where the best chance to see historical buildings in a city by taking an old map and warping it to fit on a current map. The most notable change to the Omaha map that I used, was the change in the river. Not only was the river in a different position but some parts of the city, on the old map, were not even there anymore due to what seems reasonable to assume, that the river had flooded out the buildings.The map I used was “Omaha District Map 1866” from the David Rumsey Historical Map Collection.
