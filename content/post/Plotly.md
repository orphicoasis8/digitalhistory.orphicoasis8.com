## Plotly

Plotly was fun to play with even though I didn't have my own information to use as input. I did like the different graphs and I think I learned more about graphs here than I ever did in any school. It probably helps that computers are used much more than the rocks we were given to use for all of our subjects. I don't think all graphs can be used so well for certain information and I did come across one which made me wonder that it wouldn't be useful for any kind of information. It's very confusing to place dots were a person is most likely to misinterpret what it is supposed to mean.

I believe I picked out a few interesting and fun graphs. I picked these for readability on something we might all be interested in. Unfortunately, I am hoping that it's graph form will keep anyone from asking if the information is valid and where are the sources. A very reliable source (magic 8 ball) said that the chances of anyone asking about my sources is "Highly unlikely." Good thing too because I looked and I couldn't find sources. For my own sake, Plotly was used for me to check out the many different ways I could display information visually more than looking to see what kind of facts I could dredge out.
