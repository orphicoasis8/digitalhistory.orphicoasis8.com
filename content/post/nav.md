### [January 17, 2018]({{< ref "week1.md" >}})
This first week of class starts off with some readings to introduce us to the introduction of computers and to the internet itself.


### [January 24, 2018]({{< ref "week2.md" >}})
A first introduction to Roy Rosenzweig this week in the readings. This week starts the discussion on the difference between digital history and digital humanities.


### [January 31, 2018]({{< ref "week3p1.md" >}})
This week continued the discussion on digital history versus digital humanities and gave us some examples of digital history projects.


### [The Lost Museum]({{< ref "week3p2.md" >}})
Of the long list of digital history projects to review, this one gave me enough to talk about.


### [February 7, 2018]({{< ref "week4.md" >}})
This week prepares us for Github. We do some reading on Markdown and Github itself and it's time to jump in.


### [February 14, 2018]({{< ref "Digital History for Feb 14th.md" >}})
This week we focus on data. Are we saving enough data or losing too much? In class we worked with Open Refine.


### [February 21, 2018]({{< ref "Digital History for Feb 21st.md" >}})
The focus is on digital archives and their metadata which leads us into the Dublin Core standards. We created our own Omeka collection, from the collections of others, following the metadata standards as best we can.


### [February 28, 2018]({{< ref "Digital History for Feb 28th.md" >}})
A great week noses deep in spreadsheets. This week gives a look at spreadsheets versus databases and some tools to convert the two. 


### [Airtable]({{< ref "Airtable Tool.md" >}})
This is my first time use of Airtable. Unfortunately I did not get to play with it as much as I would have liked but it is at ready for a personal project.


### [March 7, 2018]({{< ref "Digital History for March 7th.md" >}})
This week we dive into maps. We look at spatial history and Georectification. 


### [MapWarper]({{< ref "MapWarper.md" >}})
This is a Georectified map of a late 1800's Omaha over the current Omaha. I messed with this map for weeks!


### [March 28, 2018]({{< ref "Digital History for March 28th.md" >}})
This was a week for blending our data with maps. Very interesting class meeting.


### [Carto]({{< ref "Carto.md" >}})
I didn't feel that this tool exercise became any more interesting at home. The best parts are what we saw in class. I believe this is the tool that no longer has a valid link. I should have taken a screen shot.


### [April 4, 2018]({{< ref "Digital History for April 4th.md" >}})
All about visualizations! I learned that visualizations are more than just graphs.


### [Plotly]({{< ref "Plotly.md" >}})
Fun graphs that make us feel embarrassed and then mad. And one at the end that makes you question where all that information is supposed to come from.


### [April 11, 2018]({{< ref "Digital History for April 11.md" >}})
Text mining. Many have tried to convince me of its usefulness. Eh.


### [Voyant]({{< ref "Voyant.md" >}})
For being the most recent tool, I can barely remember it. Oh yes. It was fun to play with for a few minutes.


### [April 25, 2018]({{< ref "Digital History for April 25.md" >}})
The readings didn't appeal to me too much this week. But programming!! I think I like this very much! Until I get angry at it, so, any minute now.
